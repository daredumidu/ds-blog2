# About

Hi there! Iâ€™m Harshitha, a final-year Computer Science and Engineering student with a passion for building meaningful solutions and making an impact through technology. 

Over the past three years, Iâ€™ve been honing my Python skills and diving deep into Data Science and Machine Learning, areas Iâ€™ve truly come to love. My journey has taken me across national and international internships, giving me hands-on experience and shaping the way I approach challenges. 

At UniversitÃ© de Sherbrookeâ€™s Labrie Lab (QubÃ©c, Canada) , I discovered my love for research. It was an incredible experience where I strengthened my skills in Python, data visualization, web development, and executing end-to-end projects. 

During my time with Alcovex Product Studio, I worked on Interview Buddy, gaining valuable insights into building ML pipelines, designing and evaluating models, working with Docker, and benchmarking processes. 

Beyond work, Iâ€™m deeply involved in the tech community. I love connecting with people, sharing knowledge, conducting sessions, and speaking at eventsâ€”itâ€™s my way of giving back and staying inspired. 

Iâ€™m always on the lookout for opportunities to learn, grow, and collaborate on projects that make a difference. Letâ€™s connect and create something amazing together! ðŸš€
